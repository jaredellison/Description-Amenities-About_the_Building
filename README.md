# Description-Amenities-About_the_Building

   This repo holds the information for a single component of a listing page of a replica site modeling popular real estate website StreetEasy.com. The entire listing page utilizes microservice architecture and this component itself was designed as a full-stack service with a database and a web server that relays information between a client application and a RESTful API.

   This particular component renders an interactive description box consisting of a listing information table, description text, amenities, and about-the-building information. Multiple description boxes exist within the database of the application and each one is rendered on the client applicaton based on a corresponding listing ID number between 0 and 99. The higher the listing ID, the more features the listing will have and, thus, more will be loaded to the client. 

   A team of developers each designed individual components and created them as full-stack applications, ultimately collaborating to create a complete listing page. The final application can be found [here](https://github.com/Team-Elysium/real-estate-listing-page).
